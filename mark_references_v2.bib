abstract = {"The Behavior and Ecology of Pacific Salmon and Trout combines in-depth scientic information with outstanding photography and original artwork to fully describe fish species critical to the Pacific Rim. This completely revised and updated edition covers all aspects of the life cycle of these remarkable fish in the Pacific: homing migration from the open ocean through coastal waters and up rivers to their breeding grounds; courtship and reproduction; the lives of juvenile salmon and trout in rivers and lakes; migration to the sea; the structure of fish populations; and the importance of fish carcasses to the ecosystem. The book also includes information on salmon and trout transplanted outside their ranges"--},
